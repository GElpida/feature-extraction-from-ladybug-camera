### Cityscapes 
The Cityscapes project includes a few pre-trained models on [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) that were built on Detectron 2. You can fined them on [detectron2/projects](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/tree/main/projects) or download them directly from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y1rjF-It2wOA_ZSfxxa4Hoy8YjUrZrK_?usp=sharing). 

More specifically, the subfolder "panoptic" includes Panoptic-Deeplab models while "sem_seg" includes Deeplab models.

### Crosswalk
The Crosswalk project includes a pre-trained model on Roboflow's [Crosswalk dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/detectioncompetition/detection2.0) that was trained and evaluated on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ARW5_gVc_50FBHFN8Wksj9YVHebLQ3P8?usp=drive_link).
