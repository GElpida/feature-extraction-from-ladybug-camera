# feature-extraction-from-ladybug-camera
For this project a methodology was developed that utilizes data from a Mobile Mapping System -which uses a multi-camera Ladybug as a mapping sensor- to extract features from the Ladybug images and determine their spatial coordinates.

The methodolody uses the Detectron 2 Computer Vision Framework
